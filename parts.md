# First we start making the html structure

Don't need to explain much, maybe talk a little about using the [actual website](https://www.rockstargames.com/VI) code

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="overlay"></div>
  <div class="hero-1-container">
    <div class="hero-main-container">
      <img
        class="hero-main-logo"
        src="./src/assets/gta_logo_cut.webp"
        alt="gta logo"
      />
      <img
        class="hero-main-image"
        src="./src/assets//gta_hero.webp"
        alt="gta logo"
      />
    </div>
    <div class="hero-text-logo-container">
      <div class="hero-text-logo"></div>
      <div>
        <h3 class="hero-text">
          Coming<br />
          May 26<br />
          2026
        </h3>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="hero-2-container">
    <h3>Vice City, USA.</h3>
    <p>
      Jason and Lucia have always known the deck is stacked against them. But
      when an easy score goes wrong, they find themselves on the darkest side of
      the sunniest place in America, in the middle of a criminal conspiracy
      stretching across the state of Leonida â€” forced to rely on each other more
      than ever if they want to make it out alive.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
```

# Then let's make the css

Copy the code like each selector at time, do a quick explanation of what the major things does and say that if you want a more detailed video you can like and ask for it on the comments.

# Lastly we talk about the javascript

Do the first gsap animation and set the scrolltrigger, don't explain much about it.

Then we can start just copying the other timeline effects
